Scripting in Java
=================

The Bean Scripting Framework (http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-bsf/) provides scripting languages support within Java. With the JSR 223 (Scripting for the Java Platform) Java 1.6 included javax.script as a standard scripting framework (http://jcp.org/aboutJava/communityprocess/final/jsr223/index.html).

Based on the KataRange (http://codingdojo.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?KataRange) I've started to (re-)implement this kata within different languages:
- Java
- Javascript
- Groovy
- Clojure
- Jaskell (Haskell)
- Sleep (Perl)
- ABCL
- JRuby
- Jython
- Beanshell
